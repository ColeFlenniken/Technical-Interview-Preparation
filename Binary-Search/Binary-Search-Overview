I assume most of you have hear of binary search so I will keep this section short. Binary search is a of searching a list within 
O(log(n)) time complexity. Note: when log() is referenced in this I am typically refering to log base 2. It is an efficient 
algorithm to find an element in a list with one caveat, the list must be sorted. 

How much faster is this than a linear search? Assume it takes 1 millisecond each time we read an element in the array (it is much less 
reality). for an array of 8 elements, a linear search will take 8ms and a binary seach will only take 3ms. This is faster but not by 
much. Now lets assume the array has 16,777,216 elements. Linear search will take 16,777,216ms or about 4.7 hours. In contrast, binary 
search will only take 24ms. Here the advantage becomes more apparent.

How does a binary search work? To start, a binary search looks at the middle element in the array. If the element is to the target value, then we just return
the value. Otherwise, the array being sorted comes into play. If our target value is greater than the middle element then we 
know it must be to the right of the middle element. If it is less than the target it must be to the left. With this knowledge 
we now only need to search one half of the array. If we repeatedly do this, we can cut half of the remaining array out each
iteration. 

Binary search can also appear in a less traditional fashion. The list must be sorted but, sorted does not always refer to ordering elements in increasing value. 
For example, lets say that we have a list of integers paired with another identical integer exept for one integer missing its pair (ex. [5,5,6,1,1,3,3,2,2]). 
Binary search can be used to find the stand alone element, six in this case.
